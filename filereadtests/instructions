File-read test

These instructions assume you have a Condor pool to use for running jobs. See the file-open test instructions
to create such a pool.

1. A file list is needed. Each job will read from a different file. Use the full file list for a site from the 
file-open test and split it into smaller files:

split -d -a 3 T2_US_ABCD.files filenameprefix

where T2_US_ABCD.files is the full file list, and filenameprefix is some file name prefix for the smaller
files that will be created.

2. Create a directory for the current day, like 2012-04-03, and cd into it.

3. Create the submit files with mkreadjobs.sh:

../mkreadjobs.sh 900  filelist    root://xrootd.unl.edu//store/test/xrootd/T2_US_ABCD

filelist should be one of the files created in step 1. Every time a file-read test is done for the same site,
a different file can be used so no effects of file caching will confound the test results.

4. cd into the newly created directory for the site and do:

echo submit* | xargs -n1 condor_submit
/afs/hep.wisc.edu/cms/sw/AAA/scaletest/ramp_up_jobs 50 240 800 >& ramp.log < /dev/null &

5. The jobs will run for about an hour. Monitor them with condor_q.

6. Run get_times to get the start timestamp and test duration:

../../get_times

The first timestamp output is the starting one, and the last number is the test duration.

7. To make the plots, use readjobsplot.py. See runplots.sh for an example of the parameters it requires:

python readjobsplot.py stdout_file_list test_duration bin_size start_timestamp RTT sitename target_time

stdout_file_list is the list of the stdout files from the test, test_duration is the duration of the test in seconds,
bin_size is the bin size for the plots in seconds (usually about test_duration/20), and start_timestamp
is the time stamp of the first file-read attempt.

RTT is the round-trip time from your location to the site. If you can find the name of the XrootD server at the site,
you can use ping to find the RTT. It is usually around 0.05 s.

target_time is 4 for the standard file-read test. This parameter is the intended time in seconds for a job to read 1 MB.
